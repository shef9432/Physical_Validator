## 🚩 About
In industrial deployment, AI model performance is often fragile against physical environmental fluctuations. **PVA (Physical Validator Audit)** is a decoupled evaluation framework designed to quantify the performance boundaries of vision models under varying physical stresses.

**The Core Philosophy:**
PVA is an **Industrial AI Reliability Assurance System**. We believe that in mission-critical manufacturing, the training process is only the beginning—the **Reliability Loop** is what truly defines production readiness. 



---

## 🏗️ Core Modules
- **PhysCorruptor:** A simulation engine that injects controlled physical variables (Lux, DPI, Motion Blur, Defocus, ISO Noise) into raw samples to stress-test model robustness.
- **Audit Logger:** Outputs standardized performance metrics (CSV/JSON) for deep-dive production auditing.
- **Inference Bridge:** A model-agnostic interface supporting third-party architectures (e.g., YOLO, ResNet) via standard protocols without modifying core model code.
- **Analysis Tool:** Visualization utilities for mapping the **Safe Operating Area (SOA)** and identifying the model's "breaking point."

## 📊 Assessment Dimensions

| Physical Factor | Industrial Context | Implementation Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lux** | Environmental light fluctuation | Linear scaling & Gamma adjustment |
| **Motion Blur** | Conveyor/Mechanical vibration | Directional convolution kernels |
| **DPI/Res** | Working distance variations | Area-based resampling |
| **Defocus** | Focal drift | Gaussian-based degradation |
| **ISO Noise** | Low-light sensor gain | Gaussian-Normal injection |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from pva import PhysCorruptor, Auditor
```

# 1. Initialize the audit engine
config = {"lux": 0.5, "motion_blur": 3} 
corruptor = PhysCorruptor(input_data)
auditor = Auditor(model)

# 2. Execute black-box auditing
degraded_data = corruptor.apply(config)
report = auditor.evaluate(degraded_data)

# 3. Analyze the Safe Operating Area (SOA)
report.show_soa_map()
🗺️ Roadmap: The Evolution of Industrial Reliability
Phase 1: Physical Audit (The Present)
Infrastructure: Established PhysCorruptor and Audit Logger.

Focus: Quantifying the Safe Operating Area (SOA) under basic optical and environmental stressors.

Phase 2: Parametric Engineering (In Progress)
Golden Reference Mapping: Integrating high-fidelity "Golden Reference" data to map the optimal synergy between hardware and algorithmic parameters.

Degradation Engines: Developing physically consistent degradation models to simulate complex material distortions and optical reflections.

Phase 3: Cognitive Defense & Safety (Future)
Adversarial Closed-loop: Implementation of "Anti-Fact" data injection to detect model hallucinations.

Re-calibration Engine: Enabling automatic model rollbacks or re-calibration when the system enters a "Logic Wasteland" (i.e., non-physical confident predictions).

Cross-Domain Expansion: * Control-PV: Assessing stability against network jitter and mechanical backlash.

Language-PV/Medical-PV: Extending robustness auditing to acoustic and bio-signal domains.
